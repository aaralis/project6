All right, fellas. Let's get to it.

Alex gets the Server, as he requested.

I will take the Request.

That leaves you with the Response, Curtis.

Enjoy!

Please commit all code updates.
If you have questions on how to use GitHub, send me a text or something.

Thanks,
Ben

P.S. TIMELINE: I would like all code finished by 11/7 so that I can run a few tests before submitting! I am really anal  when it comes to my grades.
